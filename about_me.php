			<h1> Jodie </h1>
			<p> A 2019 graduate of QUT, I'm not the most experienced programmer; but it's something I love and I am
			more than happy to pour hours of a day into a project I'm passionate about. For me, Opti is a 
			way to share this passion with others. Most of the things I build solve a problem I face myself.</p>
			<p> Besides programming, I play around with a plethora of other activities including singing, gaming,
			and animation. <!--You can see some of my other passions at play with the links below- and don't forget
			the Opti social media too~!--></p><!--
