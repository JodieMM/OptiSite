			<span class="month-pointer"></span>
			<p>August is a big month for Optimator with the offical site
			going live! This means accounts will be able to be made for the first time
			and this will serve as a platform to access the Alpha of Optimator when it is ready.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="timeline" month="September">
			<span class="month-pointer"></span>
			<p>The long-awaited Alpha! This will be the first time Optimator is released publicly
			for you to play around with. This Alpha version will still be quite rough so it will
			be released for free with no trial period or license. It will also be released on a smaller
			scale to the Beta, so only those currently following the Opti social media will be alerted when
			it is released.</p>
			<p>It is still uncertain whether the file versions made with the Alpha will be included in the 
			version changer. If they're not, you may be unable to use files created in the Alpha in
			future versions of Optimator as the way files are saved will change, and hence they cannot
			be read in the same way.</p>
