			<p>August is a big month for Optimator with the offical site
			going live! This means accounts will be able to be made for the first time
			and this will serve as a platform to access the Beta of Optimator when it is ready.</p>

		<div class="timeline" month="September">
			<span class="month-pointer"></span>
			<p>The long-awaited Beta! This will be the first time Optimator is released publicly
			for you to play around with.</p>
			<p>It is still uncertain whether the file versions made with the Beta will be included in the 
			version changer. If they're not, you may be unable to use files created in the Beta in
			future versions of Optimator.</p>
