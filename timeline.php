			<p>The long-awaited Beta! This will be the first time Optimator is released publicly
			for you to play around with. The beta will be free for everyone as the software will still lack certain features and
			will have a lower visual quality, but it will allow you to test out the base functionality and get an idea of 
			how Optimator works.</p>
