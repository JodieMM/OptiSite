		<div class="timeline" month="September">
			<span class="month-pointer"></span>
			<p>September is a big month for Optimator with the offical site
			going live! This means accounts will be able to be made for the first time
			and this will serve as a platform to access the Beta of Optimator when it is ready.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="timeline" month="October">
			<span class="month-pointer"></span>
			<p>The long-awaited Beta! This will be the first time Optimator is released publicly
			for you to play around with. The beta will be free for everyone as the software will still lack certain features and
			will have a lower visual quality, but it will allow you to test out the base functionality and get an idea of 
			how Optimator works.</p>
			<p>We're very excited here at Opti for this Beta release, but we also think it's important to do it right- this means
			it is possible the Beta will be pushed back another month. Subscribe to notifications to be informed 
			as soon as it's ready!</p>
